        <h1 class="text-dark text-lg-center p-lg-3">What is HTML</h1>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. HTML consists of a series of tags and attributes that are used to mark up and structure the text and other content on a webpage.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>How does HTML work?</h1>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">When a web page is requested by a browser, the server sends the HTML code to the browser, which then interprets the code and displays the webpage to the user. HTML is the backbone of every webpage on the internet, and it provides the basic structure and content that the browser needs to display the webpage properly.    </p>
        <h1>Why is HTML important?</h1>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">HTML is important because it allows web developers to create and structure web pages in a standardized way that can be easily understood and interpreted by browsers. Without HTML, web pages would be difficult to create and would not be displayed consistently across different devices and browsers.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">HTML also allows for accessibility features, such as alt text for images and headings for screen readers, which make websites more accessible to people with disabilities. Additionally, HTML is constantly evolving and improving, with new versions being released periodically to improve the language and add new features.</p>
        <h1>History of HTML</h1>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">
            The development of HTML can be traced back to the late 1980s when Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, invented the World Wide Web. At that time, there was no standardized way to create web pages, and each web page had its own unique structure and format.

In 1989, Berners-Lee created the first version of HTML, which was a simple markup language used to structure text on web pages. The early versions of HTML were limited in their capabilities, and the markup was primarily used to structure headings, paragraphs, and lists.

Over time, the language evolved, and new versions of HTML were released, each with new features and capabilities. Today, the latest version of HTML is HTML5, which was released in 2014.
        </p>
        <h1>Features of HTML</h1>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">
            HTML is a markup language that consists of a series of tags and attributes. Tags are used to mark up content on a web page, while attributes provide additional information about the content. Here are some of the key features of HTML:

Structure: HTML provides a way to structure the content on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists.

Links: HTML allows you to create links to other web pages, images, and other resources.

Images: HTML supports the use of images on web pages, including the ability to resize and position images.

Forms: HTML provides a way to create forms on web pages, allowing users to input data and submit it to a server.

Multimedia: HTML supports the use of multimedia elements on web pages, such as video and audio.

Accessibility: HTML includes features to make web pages more accessible, such as alt text for images and headings for screen readers.
        </p>
        <h1>Importance of HTML</h1>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">HTML is the backbone of the web. Without HTML, it would be impossible to create web pages that are accessible and easy to navigate. HTML provides a standardized way to create web pages, ensuring that they can be interpreted by browsers on any device.

            HTML is also essential for search engine optimization (SEO). By using HTML tags to structure the content on a web page, web developers can make it easier for search engines to crawl and index the content, improving its visibility in search results.
            
            Furthermore, HTML is constantly evolving, with new versions being released periodically to improve the language and add new features. HTML5, for example, introduced new multimedia elements, such as video and audio, making it easier to embed multimedia content on web pages.</p>

    <h1>WHAT IS HTML TAG</h1>
    <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">HTML tags are a set of predefined codes or keywords used to markup content in a web page. They are used to create and define elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets < > and consist of an opening tag &lt;tag&gt; and a closing tag &lt;/tag&gt;, with the content in between.

        For example, the  &lt;h1&gt; tag is used to define a heading in HTML. The opening tag would be &lt;h1&gt; and the closing tag would be &lt;/h1&gt; with the heading content in between the two tags like so: &lt;h1>My Heading&gt;/h1>
        
        There are many other tags in HTML, each with its own purpose and function. By using HTML tags, web developers can structure and format web pages to create a visually appealing and functional website.
        </p>
        <h1>HOW MANY TAGS IN HTML</h1>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">There are many tags in HTML, each with its own purpose and function. As of HTML5, there are over 100 different HTML tags available for use in web development. However, not all of these tags are commonly used or necessary for every web page. Some of the most commonly used HTML tags include:</p><br>
        <ul>
            <li>&lt;HTML&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;HEAD&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;TITLE&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;HEAD&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;BODY&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;HEAD&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;H1&gt; TO &lt;H6&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;P&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;A&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;IMG&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;UL&gt; AND &lt;LI&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;OL&gt; AND &lt;LI&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;TABLE&gt;,&lt;TR&gt;,&lt;TD&gt; AND &lt;TH&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;FORM&gt;,&lt;BUTTON&gt;,&lt;INPUT&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;DIV&gt; AND &lt;SPAN&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;STYLE&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>WHY &lt;HTML&gt; TAG IS USED</h1>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">The &lt;html&gt; tag is the root element of an HTML document, and it is used to define the beginning and end of the HTML code.

            Every HTML document starts with an opening &lt;html&gt; tag and ends with a closing &lt;/html&gt; tag. Everything that is included between these tags is considered the HTML document.
            
            The &lt;html&gt; tag provides important information about the document, such as the document type and language. For example, the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration, which comes before the &lt;html&gt; tag, specifies that the document is an HTML5 document.
            
            In addition, the &lt;html&gt; tag may contain attributes that specify other information about the document, such as the character set and encoding.
            
            Overall, the &lt;html&gt; tag is a necessary component of an HTML document, as it defines the document and its attributes, and provides a structure for all of the content that appears within the document.
            </p>
    <!--JS link-->
    <h1>WHY &lt;HEAD&gt; TAG IS USED</h1>
    <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">The <head> tag is used in HTML to define the section of a web page that contains information about the page that is not displayed in the main content area of the browser window. This information includes metadata, links to external resources, and scripts.</p>
        <h1>WHY &lt;TITLE&gt; TAG IS USED</h1>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">
            The &lt;title   &gt; tag in HTML is used to define the title of a web page. It is an essential element of a web page's head section, and appears in the browser's title bar and in the search engine results pages (SERPs) as the title of the page.

                Here are some of the key reasons why the &lt;title&gt; tag is so important for web development and search engine optimization (SEO):
        </p>
        <h1>WHY &lt;BODY&gt;TAG IS USED</h1>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">The &lt;body&gt; tag in HTML is used to define the main content of a web page. It is one of the most important tags in HTML, as it contains all of the visible content that appears on the web page, such as text, images, videos, and other media.

            The &lt;body&gt;tag is typically placed immediately after the &lt;head&gt; tag and contains all of the visible elements of the web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. It can also contain other HTML tags and attributes, such as tables, forms, and scripts, that allow for more advanced functionality and interactivity on the web page.</p>
        <h1>Why &lt;H1&gt; , &lt;h6&gt; TAG is Used</h1>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;, with &lt;h1&gt; being the most important and &lt;h6&gt; being the least important.

            The main purpose of the &lt;h&gt; tags is to provide structure and hierarchy to the content of a web page. They help users to easily navigate the page and understand the relationship between different sections of content.</p>
            <h1>WHY &lt;P&gt; TAG IS USE</h1>
            <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">The &lt;p&gt; tag in HTML is used to define a paragraph of text. It is one of the most commonly used tags in HTML, as most web pages contain a significant amount of text content that needs to be organized into paragraphs.

                Using the &lt;p&gt; tag helps to create a clear visual structure for the text content of a web page. By breaking the content into smaller, more easily digestible chunks, readers can scan through the page more quickly and easily, and find the information they are looking for</p>
                <h1>WHY &lt;A&gt; TAG IS USED</h1>
                <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">
                    The &lt;a&gt; tag in HTML is used to create hyperlinks or clickable links to other web pages, files, or resources on the internet. The a stands for "anchor" because it creates a link that allows users to "anchor" from one web page to another or from one part of a web page to another.
                </p>
                <h1>WHY &lt;img&gt; TAG IS USED</h1>
                <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">
                    The &lt;img&gt; tag in HTML is used to display images on a web page. It is a self-closing tag, meaning it does not require a closing tag, and is used to embed images in the content of a web page.
                    the &lt;img&gt tag is an essential tool for displaying images on a web page. By using the tag, developers can create a more visually appealing and engaging user experience, while also improving the accessibility and SEO of the web page.
                </p>
                <h1>WHY &lt;UL&gt; AND &lt;LI&gt; TAG IS USED</h1>
                <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">
                    The  &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt; tags in HTML are used to create unordered lists on a web page. The  &lt;ul&gt; tag defines the beginning of an unordered list, while the  &lt;li&gt; tag defines each item in the list.
                </p>
                <h1>WHY &lt;OL&gt; AND &lt;LI&gt; TAG IS USED</h1>
                <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">The &lt;ol&gt;and &lt;li&gt; tags in HTML are used to create ordered lists on a web page. The &lt;ol&gt; tag defines the beginning of an ordered list, while the &lt;li&gt; tag defines each item in the list.</p>
                <h1>WHY &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;,&lt;td&gt; AND &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;</h1>
                <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">The  &lt;table&gt;,  &lt;tr&gt;,  &lt;td&gt;, and  &lt;th&gt; tags in HTML are used to create tables on a web page.
<br>
                    Here's how each tag is used:</p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>The &lt;table&gt; tag defines the beginning of a table on a web page.</li>
                        <li>The &lt;tr&gt; tag defines a row in the table.</li>
                        <li>The &lt;td&gt; tag defines a cell in the table.</li>
                        <li>The &lt;th&gt; tag defines a header cell in the table.</li>
                    </ul>   
                    <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">Here are some of the key reasons why the &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;td&gt;, and &lt;th&gt; tags are so important for web development:

                        Content organization: Tables are a great way to organize and present complex data on a web page. By using the &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;td&gt;, and &lt;th&gt; tags, developers can create a structured table that is easy to read and navigate.
                        
                        Styling: Tables can also be styled using CSS to create a visually appealing and cohesive design for the table. This can include things like changing the border style or adding padding and margins to the cells.
                        
                        Accessibility: Tables can also be used to improve the accessibility of a web page. By using descriptive text for each cell and header cell, developers can make the content more accessible to users who are visually impaired or who are using a screen reader to navigate the web.
                        
                        SEO: The use of tables on a web page can also help to improve its SEO. Search engines use the structure and organization of content to understand the context and relevance of a web page, and using tables can help to make the content more structured and organized.
                        
                        Overall, the &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;td&gt;, and &lt;th&gt; tags are important tools for organizing and presenting complex data on a web page. By using these tags, developers can create a more visually appealing and accessible user experience, while also improving the SEO of the web page.

                        <h1>WHY &lt;FORM&gt;,&lt;BUTTON&gt;,&lt;INPUT&gt; IS USED</h1>
                        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">The &lt;form&gt;, &lt;button&gt;, and &lt;button&gt; are commonly used HTML elements that allow for the creation of interactive web pages.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>&lt;FORM&gt;: The &lt;FORM&gt; element is used to create an area on a web page where users can enter information. It can contain various types of form elements such as &lt;input&gt; elements, &lt;select&gt; elements, &lt;textarea&gt; elements, and more. When the user submits the form, the data is sent to the server for processing.</li>
                            <li>&lt;button&gt;: The &lt;button&gt; element is used to create a clickable button on a web page. It can be used to trigger JavaScript functions or to submit a form.</li>
                            <li>&lt;input&gt;: The &lt;input&gt; element is used to create various types of form controls such as text input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more. The type attribute of the &lt;input&gt; element determines the type of control that is created.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">Overall, these elements are used to create interactive web pages that allow users to input data, trigger actions, and interact with web applications.</p>
                        <h1>WHY &lt;DIV&gt; AND &lt;SPAN&gt;,&lt; IS USED</h1>
                        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">The &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; elements are commonly used HTML elements that are used to group and organize content on a web page.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>&lt;div&gt;: The &lt;div&gt; element is used to create a container for grouping larger sections of content together. It can be used to group related elements, create a layout for a web page, or apply styling to a group of elements. It can also be used to apply JavaScript or CSS to a specific section of a web page.</li>
                            <li>&lt;span&gt;: The &lt;span&gt; element is used to group smaller sections of content together. It can be used to apply formatting or styling to a specific piece of text, such as changing the font color or font size. It is commonly used in combination with other HTML elements to target specific pieces of content for styling or scripting purposes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">Both &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; elements are flexible and can be used in a variety of ways to structure and style content on a web page. They are both block-level elements, but the main difference is that &lt;div&gt; elements are used for larger sections of content while &lt;span&gt; elements are used for smaller pieces of content.</p>
                        <h1>WHY &lt;STYLE&gt; IS USED</h1>
                        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">The &lt;style&gt; tag is used in HTML to define the styling information for a web page. It is an element that contains CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) code, which is used to describe how elements on the web page should be presented and displayed to the user.

                            By using the &lt;style&gt tag, web developers can apply various visual styles to elements on a web page, such as the font size, font family, color, background color, padding, margin, and more. These styles can be applied to specific elements on a web page or to all elements on the page, depending on how the CSS code is written.
                            
                            The &lt;style&gt; tag can be included in the head section of an HTML document, and it can also be included in an external CSS file that is linked to the HTML document. Using an external CSS file allows for more efficient web development, as it allows the developer to apply consistent styles across multiple web pages on a website.
                            
                            Overall, the &lt;style&gt; tag is used to define the presentation of HTML elements on a web page, and it is an important tool for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites.</p>
                            <h1>WHY &lt;SCRIPT&gt; IS USED</h1>
                            <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">The &lt;script&gt; tag is used in HTML to include JavaScript code on a web page. JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used in web development to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

                                By using the &lt;script&gt; tag, web developers can write JavaScript code directly in an HTML document, or they can include an external JavaScript file that is linked to the HTML document. JavaScript code can be used to manipulate HTML elements on a web page, such as changing the text content, modifying the CSS styling, or adding and removing elements from the page.
                                
                                JavaScript can also be used to add interactivity to a web page, such as responding to user actions like button clicks, form submissions, or mouse events.

                                In addition to JavaScript, the &lt;script&gt; tag can also be used to include other types of scripting languages, such as VBScript or PHP, although these are less commonly used on modern web pages.
                                
                                Overall, the &lt;script&gt; tag is an essential tool for web developers, as it allows them to create dynamic and interactive web pages by including JavaScript code directly in an HTML document or by linking to an external JavaScript file.
