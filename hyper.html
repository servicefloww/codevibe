        <h1 class="text-dark text-lg-center p-lg-3">What is HTML</h1>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. HTML consists of a series of tags and attributes that are used to mark up and structure the text and other content on a webpage.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>How does HTML work?</h1>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">When a web page is requested by a browser, the server sends the HTML code to the browser, which then interprets the code and displays the webpage to the user. HTML is the backbone of every webpage on the internet, and it provides the basic structure and content that the browser needs to display the webpage properly.    </p>
        <h1>Why is HTML important?</h1>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">HTML is important because it allows web developers to create and structure web pages in a standardized way that can be easily understood and interpreted by browsers. Without HTML, web pages would be difficult to create and would not be displayed consistently across different devices and browsers.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">HTML also allows for accessibility features, such as alt text for images and headings for screen readers, which make websites more accessible to people with disabilities. Additionally, HTML is constantly evolving and improving, with new versions being released periodically to improve the language and add new features.</p>
        <h1>History of HTML</h1>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">
            The development of HTML can be traced back to the late 1980s when Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, invented the World Wide Web. At that time, there was no standardized way to create web pages, and each web page had its own unique structure and format.

In 1989, Berners-Lee created the first version of HTML, which was a simple markup language used to structure text on web pages. The early versions of HTML were limited in their capabilities, and the markup was primarily used to structure headings, paragraphs, and lists.

Over time, the language evolved, and new versions of HTML were released, each with new features and capabilities. Today, the latest version of HTML is HTML5, which was released in 2014.
        </p>
        <h1>Features of HTML</h1>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">
            HTML is a markup language that consists of a series of tags and attributes. Tags are used to mark up content on a web page, while attributes provide additional information about the content. Here are some of the key features of HTML:

Structure: HTML provides a way to structure the content on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists.

Links: HTML allows you to create links to other web pages, images, and other resources.

Images: HTML supports the use of images on web pages, including the ability to resize and position images.

Forms: HTML provides a way to create forms on web pages, allowing users to input data and submit it to a server.

Multimedia: HTML supports the use of multimedia elements on web pages, such as video and audio.

Accessibility: HTML includes features to make web pages more accessible, such as alt text for images and headings for screen readers.
        </p>
        <h1>Importance of HTML</h1>
        <p class="text-black-50 form-control-lg">HTML is the backbone of the web. Without HTML, it would be impossible to create web pages that are accessible and easy to navigate. HTML provides a standardized way to create web pages, ensuring that they can be interpreted by browsers on any device.

            HTML is also essential for search engine optimization (SEO). By using HTML tags to structure the content on a web page, web developers can make it easier for search engines to crawl and index the content, improving its visibility in search results.
            
            Furthermore, HTML is constantly evolving, with new versions being released periodically to improve the language and add new features. HTML5, for example, introduced new multimedia elements, such as video and audio, making it easier to embed multimedia content on web pages.</p>
